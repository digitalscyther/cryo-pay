        <h6>üîí Authentication</h6>
        <p>
            Access to the API requires an <strong>API key</strong>. Generate your
            API key in the <em>Settings</em> section of your account. Include it in
            the request headers like this:

        {/* New Section: Accessing and Sharing Invoices */}
        <h6>üîó Accessing and Sharing Invoices</h6>
        <p>
            Once an invoice is created, it becomes available at a unique, shareable URL. You can find this URL in
            the
            invoice details.
            The format of the URL is:
        </p>
        <pre>{invoice_url}</pre>
        <p>
            For example:
        </p>
        <pre>{invoice_url_example}</pre>
        <p>
            You can share this URL directly with your clients for payment.
        </p>

        {/* New Section: Callback URL for Post-Payment Redirection */}
        <h6>üîÑ Post-Payment Redirection with Callback URL</h6>
        <p>
            You can specify a <code>callback_url</code> as a query parameter when sharing the invoice URL.
            After a successful payment, the user will be automatically redirected to this URL. This is useful for
            integrating the payment process with your application's workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example of an invoice URL with a <code>callback_url</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>{invoice_url_with_callback_url}</pre>
        <p>
            In this example, after the payment is completed, the user will be redirected
            to <code>{redirect_url}</code>.
            You can use this to update your system about the payment status, display a custom message to the user,
            or
            trigger other actions in your application.
            Make sure that the provided <code>callback_url</code> is URL-encoded.
        </p>

        <h6>üéØ Pagination and Filtering</h6>
