                    <ol>
                        <li>Log in to your account (optional, but recommended for advanced features).</li>
                        <li>Go to the "Dashboard" and select "Create Invoice."</li>
                        <li>
                            Fill in the invoice details:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Amount:</strong> The payment amount in the preferred currency.</li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Blockchain Networks:</strong> Select the supported blockchain
                                    networks for the payment (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).

                        <li>Click "Submit" to generate the invoice.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        After creating an invoice, you can share it with the recipient. The invoice
                        will be visible on your dashboard for easy tracking.

                            invoices are paid. (Note: Email notifications require a subscription.)

                            <strong>Telegram Bot:</strong> Receive real-time payment updates
                            and manage invoices through our integrated Telegram bot.

                        <li>
                            Connect your MetaMask wallet to the supported blockchain network
                            listed in the invoice.
                        </li>
                        <li>Click "Pay Invoice" and confirm the payment in MetaMask.</li>
                        <li>
                            Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain (1â€“5 minutes
                            on average).

                        <li>
                            Payment status will update automatically. Notifications will
                            be sent to both the buyer and seller upon completion.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> Avoid paying the same invoice twice, as the system
                        processes payments reliably. Double-check before initiating a transaction.

                                If a payment fails, verify your wallet balance and network
                                connection. Retry the transaction from the invoice link.

                                No, invoices cannot be edited after creation. If necessary, you can
                                delete unpaid invoices and create new ones with the correct details.
