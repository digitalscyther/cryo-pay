                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Recipient Details:</strong> Provide the necessary
                        information.

            </li>
            <li>Click "Submit" to generate the invoice.</li>

        <h5>Stay Informed</h5>
        <p>
            The platform keeps you updated on invoice statuses through two
            notification channels:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Email Notifications:</strong> Get notified instantly when
                invoices are paid. (Note: Email notifications require a
                subscription.)
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Telegram Bot:</strong> Receive real-time payment updates
                and manage invoices through our integrated Telegram bot.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To enable notifications, link your Telegram account in the
            "Settings" section.

        <h5>How to Pay an Invoice</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the invoice link shared by the seller.</li>
            <li>
                Connect your MetaMask wallet to the supported blockchain network
                listed in the invoice.
            </li>
            <li>Click "Pay Invoice" and confirm the payment in MetaMask.</li>
            <li>
                Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain (1â€“5
                minutes on average).
            </li>
            <li>
                Payment status will update automatically. Notifications will be
                sent to both the buyer and seller upon completion.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Avoid paying the same invoice twice, as the
            system processes payments reliably. Double-check before initiating a
            transaction.

            <li>
                <strong>What if my payment fails?</strong>
                <p>
                    If a payment fails, verify your wallet balance and network
                    connection. Retry the transaction from the invoice link.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Can I modify an invoice after creating it?</strong>
                <p>
                    No, invoices cannot be edited after creation. If necessary, you
                    can delete unpaid invoices and create new ones with the correct
                    details.

                    Enable email notifications by verifying your email address in
